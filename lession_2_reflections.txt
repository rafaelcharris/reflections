What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git file that will keep track of all the changes in that directory. 
This is useful when I want to start commiting or cheking out to a previous version of my work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is and in-between area between working directoy and the repository. You put your files there before commiting them into the repository.
It gives more flexibility at the time of chossing which files I am uploading to the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add to the staging area only the files in which I've made a logical change. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are hepdul when you want to make another version or a big experimenatl change to the code you already have. This allows you to have two versions of the same code but make slight changes that don't change the hole structure.
