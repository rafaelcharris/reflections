When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people on a project or when I want to have acces to my information from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it may be a bug in the new code so it's better to have the option of, for example, creating a branch or not pulling it but give the user freedom on when to do it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is to copy a repository in one github account to another one. Clone is used when I want to copy a repository on github to my local machine. Finally, I branch when I want to create another local version of my code to, for example, make experimental changes or create another version of the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This is beneficial because if I am offline I could check the changes that were made on the repository before I merge it to the master branch

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collaborate using google docs. I wouldn't need to use any code, so taht would be easier. But I would have to use google docs formats only. Also, it would be more difficult to follow the version control because there wouldn't be any commit history. At the same time, the changes made to the document would be more desorganizes as everyone could change what he or she prefers.
