When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people on a project or when I want to have acces to my information from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it may be a bug in the new code so it's better to have the option of, for example, creating a branch or not pulling it but give the user freedom on when to do it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is to copy a repository in one github account to another one. Clone is used when I want to copy a repository on github to my local machine. Finally, I branch when I want to create another local version of my code to, for example, make experimental changes or create another version of the code.
